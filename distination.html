       I have visited recently Samandar Kata Lake, which is stunning with its clear blue water and surrounded by green hills.The reflections of the mountains in the lake make it look like a beautiful painting. It's a peaceful spot where you can enjoy nature's beauty and take in the calmness of the lake.
     At Samandar kata Lake, you can ride boats and feel the soft wind. If you like sitting by the water, there are comfy chairs in the shallow parts of the lake, so you can enjoy the fun of beautiful lake in great weather.</p>
